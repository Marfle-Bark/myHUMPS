\begin{abstract}
%Current Medium Access Control, MAC, Protocols are based on the premise that every device 
%has an equal probability to transmit to their data across a network. This method 
%attempts to reduce the collisions in the network by having all users who want to send 
%a packet wait a random time interval between 0 and a minimum starting back-off,
% and increasing a particular senders minimun back-off each time their packet does not
% sent. This paper attempts to discover if a Wireless MAC protocol based off of using the 
%current frame number as the upper bound of the random number function in an attempt to 
%see if a biased priority can improve the average complete time of stream transmittion time accross a 
%particuar network.

%----Main Body of the Paper

\section{Introduction}
{
%Current MAC protocols for 802.11 use a variation of the ALOHA Protocol known as p-persistant CSMA/CA, or Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance. In this protocol, once a node has assembled a message, it checks to see if the channel is idle. If not, the node waits a random backoff time before checking the channel again. Once the node is able to send through the channel, it transmits a RTS (request to send) frame to the destination node, and waits for a CTS (clear to send) frame from the destination node. If the CTS frame is not received, then the node waits a random backoff time and attempts to send again. If the CTS frame is received, the node transmits its message to its destination. With this approach, all frames are given an equal chance to transmit. However, in this protocol, the packet delay tends to increase with the amount of stations (or nodes) on the network. Instead of using a fair approach with respect to each device on the network, we plan to explore the possibility of using a biased treatment of frames in the networks to increase the overall efficiency of the network.\\
%
%Most work on biased MAC protocols is focused on either acting unfairly in order to increase one node's network performance at the cost of the performance of the other nodes on the network, or is done on keeping a node acting unfairly from destroying the network and discouraging that node from acting unfairly any more. It is our hypothesis that a biased protocol can be created that will actually increase the performance of the network. We plan to do this by examining different ways of prioritizing network traffic according to packet size, type, or even the size of the file to be transmitted.
