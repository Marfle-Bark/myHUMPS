\begin{abstract}
%Current Medium Access Control, MAC, Protocols are based on the premise that every device 
%has an equal probability to transmit to their data across a network. This method 
%attempts to reduce the collisions in the network by having all users who want to send 
%a packet wait a random time interval between 0 and a minimum starting back-off,
% and increasing a particular senders minimun back-off each time their packet does not
% sent. This paper attempts to discover if a Wireless MAC protocol based off of using the 
%current frame number as the upper bound of the random number function in an attempt to 
%see if a biased priority can improve the average complete time of stream transmittion time accross a 
%particuar network.
%
%This paper looks to improve the overall network efficiency by using a MAC protocol that biases towards Streams of shorter sizes by basing the initial back off of the packet transmission off the current frame number being sent instead of a system declared minimum initial value. This approach should improve the average time to transmit data from all nodes on the network.
In this paper, we present WiBi MAC, a biased Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for WiFi. The standard medium access approach utilized by WiFi relies upon Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) combined with slotted Aloha. This approach achieves a fair packet access scheme that is similar to Processor Sharing (PS). Biased scheduling approaches, such as Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT), have been shown to yield better throughput and faster expected completion times than PS in computer process scheduling. The WiBi MAC for Wifi approximates SRPT in order to achieve greater throughput and utilization of the wireless medium. WiBi MAC operates by having each node choose a maximum potential back off time that is proportional to the number of packets that are ready to send. By favoring packets belonging to short streams over packets belonging to longer streams, we achieve a simulated throughput improvement of XXXX over the standard fair exponential back off approach used by WiFi.

%----Main Body of the Paper

\section{Introduction}

% YOU DON"T NEED THE BRACKETS AROUND EACH SECTION

% COMMENTS - The Introduction should start with a statement of the problem. This should be followed by motivation of the problem, and why the reader cares about it. Next is a general overview of your approach followed by a summary of your main conclusions. The last paragraph has a one sentence summary of each section. I've written an example below.

%Connecting to the internet has never been easier than it is in today's world. From when computers used to take an entire room to hold them, limited connectivity to other computers outside of Universities or governmental building, and specialty training. We now can carry computers around with us, in bags, pockets, or even wear them, giving us the ability to seemlessly connect to countless others with readily available connections to Wireless networks. The ability to join a Wireless network is as simple as a few clicks of a mouse or taps on a phone, and suddenly the world is at your finger tips. The ability for people to connect from around the world is increasing at an ever expanding rate with wireless access being introduced to the most remote places. With this sudden surge in increased accessibility and user interaction comes the question of is the current connection the best we have or can we improve? 

%Current MAC protocols operate with the assumption that all data being sent should be equal regardless of the type of data or the sender \cite{5340799, FairScheduling}. Under this protocol, packets from a computer using a video service such as Netflix or youTube have equal priority as a computer sending out an email. While this works well when you are attempting to balance out all users so no user is above another, with a large number of users it can begin to slow the average time to complete sending a stream of data. Though not the best protocol available, it is also not the worst available, but it also has the possibility of improvement. As it stands now, most research in unfair MAC protocols have resolved around one of two types, malicious behavior, behaving with the intent to disrupt other users,\cite{DDoS} or selfish behavior, behaving to improve your own performance\cite{Kyasanur}

% WRITE IN THE PRESENT TENSE - THIS PAPER DOES NOT "ATTEMPT" IT DOES
%This paperwill discuss  cheating/biased MAC protocol by changing the random back-off delay before sending a packet from a number between 0 and a set minimum, to 0 and the current Frame number in current stream. This MAC protocol as a result has a natural bias towards nodes that are sending a smaller stream as they are able to keep the variable maximum for there back off delay low compared to a node that is sending a longer stream. The protocol should also be able to interact in an environment where it is the only node using this and have the network remain at the same effeciency level or have improved effciency as a result.



% THIS IS THE NEW INTRO
%
%
%Current WiFi MAC protocols are based on the network having a fair/equal chance for any node on thenetwork to send a packet they have ready to send. This approach is similar to a basic  Processor Sharing algorithm. This paper discusses a different approach by testing different methods of biasing WiFi MAC protocols by using an algorithm similar to Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT)  to determine the maximum for a pckets Random back off. In addition we will be testing this apporach along with using the current frame number of the packet being sent as the maximum value for the back off, as well as a dynamic approach of varying the back off window based on the level of traffic in the network. 

%These approaches are looking to improve the through put of the network by looking to improve the mean time to complete the data streams from nodes in a network. This approach would prefer nodes that have shorter data streams being sent leadinging to a higher number of completed data streams over a period of time when compared to the current fair exponential back off approach used by WiFi. 

%First paragraph here. // start with the basic statement - WiFi MAC protocol is inefficient and should be improved - motivate why an improved performance (name this) is beneficial and needed

Current WiFi MAC protocol is primarily designed around achieving a completely fair protocol where all nodes in the network have the equal probability to interact with the router. This allows for the network to be fair in resource allocation between the nodes at the expense of reducing the overall network throughput performance. The standard WiFi protocol works well in environments where all of the data traffic is fairly similar in size and priority but begins to suffer performance degradation when you have users with starkly different data sizes. A WiFi protocol that instead of optimizing for fairness of access optimizes for near-maximum throughput on the network would cause no negative effects when implemented in a network that has very similar data traffic size, and in the cases where a network has different sizes of data it would increase the throughput of the network by having users that have smaller data sizes will be able to transmit all of their data faster than a user that is sending a larger amount of data. 

% Second paragraph here. // Discuss how the current MAC protocol is similar to processor sharing including the back off approach.

Current WiFi works with the model of when a node has a data packet to send rolls a random number between 1 and a standard minimum value to establish a back off time for the number of slots to wait to pass before sending its data. This is similar to processor sharing in which programs have a uniformly random chance to be selected for access to the processor. Processor sharing also has functionality similar to WiFi MAC's exponential back off, for when nodes have a collision, which prevent larger programs have an increased delay between times they have access to the processor to ensure that they do not monopolize the processor ensuring that the smaller programs have the ability to use the processor as well.

%Third paragraph here // Discuss solution of SRPT and modification of the back off range and how these are biased solutions.

SRPT achieves the highest throughput, lowest mean completion time, when applied to a single channel processor\cite{schrage}. It achieves this by always choosing the nest program that has the lowest remaining process time, assuming that the time needed to complete processing is known at the start. A similar process can be implemented in the WiFi MAC protocol with the assumption that a node knows the size of the packet stream it needs to send, the node would then base the upper bound, of the back off random number selector, on the size of the packet stream that the node has left to send. As a node sends data over the network it gradually lowers its upper bound allowing it to have a higher chance of sending its remaining packets in a shorter time frame. This approach bias the network in favor for packet streams that were small in the beginning as well as streams that are near completion. For instances where the size of the packet stream is unknown a different way to bias the network towards streams of a smaller size is to base the upper bound of the random back off of the current frame number of the packet in the stream being sent. This approach has all streams start with the same range for the back off and gradually increasing the range as the node sends more and more packets successfully across the network with larger streams having a higher upper bound than the smaller streams. The final approach to creating a biased protocol that improves the throughput of the network is to dynamically alter the bounds of the back off based on the current level of traffic in the network as well as the size of the stream remaining. If the node detects that the network traffic has increased and that it has a long stream remaining then the node will increase the delay between its own packets to allow other nodes to communicate.

%Fourth paragraph here // Give basic results and the main conclusions achieved.

***** Talking with Ethan over the break to discuss the results********

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{section:relatedwork} we review related work to medium access control. In Section~\ref{section:analysis} we discuss the results of the four different simulations: standard WiFi MAC, MAC protocol based on the SRPT algorithm, back off based on the current frame number in the stream, and lastly a dynamic back off window changed based on the traffic level in the network. Finally, we draw the relevant conclusions in Section~\ref{section:conclusions}.

\section{Related Work}
\label{section:relatedwork}

% NEED RELATED WORK ON THE WIFI MAC, NOT JUST MAC PROTOCOLS. ALSO, NEED RELATED WORK ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SRPT VS PS AND OTHER RELATED PROCESSOR SCHEDULING APPROACHES.

%THIS IS A NICE ESSAY, BUT MUCH OF IT BELONGS IN THE INTRODUCTION - THE TRUE RELATED WORK IS THOSE WORKS THAT TRIED TO MODIFY WIFI MAC FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE OR PROCESSOR SCHEDULING EVALUATIONS. FIND THESE TYPES OF RELATED WORK TO INCLUDE HERE.
%So far, very little work has been done on the optimization of unfair Medium Access Protocols; most work has been done on solving the unfair MAC problem while reducing collisions. For wireless networks, a principle problem is the hidden terminal problem. In a wired network, it is possible to sense when another node is being sent, and a collision will occur \cite{869217}. In a wireless network, however, this cannot be done, resulting in the need for an alternative method of handling collisions \cite{6574961}. Thus, wireless MAC protocols like Slotted-Aloha were created.  In the Slotted Aloha Protocol, a node can only be sent at the beginning of a time slot \cite{5340799}. This ensures that one node can finish sending before another one is sent, reducing the number of collisions.  Under a network with a light load, this approach has a low chance of collision. However, collisions can still occur if two nodes are sent in the same timeslot. Under heavy loads, the probability that a node will be sent in the same timeslot as another node will increase. Most research into this problem is based on reducing collisions while keeping the distribution of sent nodes fair.  An improvement on the Slotted Aloha Protocol is the Frameless ALOHA protocol, which uses a random access scheme to decide which nodes should be sent in which spot \cite{6336861}. Another attempt at improving the Slotted-ALOHA protocol is the Generalized Slotted ALOHA protocol, in which nodes are sent according to their probability of being transmitted successfully. However, an issue with this protocol is that if every node is attempting to maximize its own transmission rate, then the network can jam. \cite{4548143 }.  The Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance for Wireless (MACAW) protocol is one attempt at improving on the Slotted-Aloha Protocol and solving the hidden terminal and unfair MAC problems. MACAW introduces fairness, in which every stream sent on the network is treated equally. This contrasts our proposal in that we create an optimal MAC protocol by prioritizing certain streams, thus creating an unfair MAC protocol that optimizes the network.


% THIS PART BELONGS IN THE RELATED WORK SECTION
Most research done on unfair MAC protocols has been conducted on how to detect and prevent unfair behavior from a node on the network. Some has focused on merely detecting and blocking the misbehaving node, while others have suggested implementing a punishment of sorts on the misbehaving nodes. Ways that nodes can misbehave in order to increase their own performance is to refuse to forward packets in order to save energy, or to select a smaller backoff in order to increase throughput for their own traffic. These misbehaving nodes can seriously degrade the network throughput for other, well-behaved nodes. \cite{Kyasanur}.

The most research has been done on detecting the manipulation of the random back off \cite{Suresh}, detecting if a node is cheating by sending before the end of the guard band %\cite{Domino?}.Want to double check this
This approach only benefits a single user as they crowd out other users as they maximize their bandwidth \cite{Domino}. As a result it also decreases the throughput of the network as other user's data is put on hold they think the communication channel is always busy. 

A similar task to creating an unfair MAC protocol that everyone follows is detecting when a single user, or a small group of users, is being unfair and the process of handling them. A few approaches to remediate unfair behavior have been to exclude the misbehaving node from routing operations, encourage nodes to cooperate by penalizing misbehavior, or to incentivise good behavior by paying nodes for cooperating. Another protocol detects unfair behavior by having a sender transmit an RTS (Request to Send) after waiting for a randomly selected number of slots in the range [0; CW].After the initial transmission between hosts, the recieving host sends with their acknowledgement: a random value that the sender then uses as the back off counter for each subsequent transmittion during the stream. \cite{Kyasanur} With this protocol, if a recieving node recieves a packet before the appropriate number of frames has passed, then the sending host is not obeying the Protocol and can then be handled accordingly.

Our purpose, however, is to prove that implementing an unfair protocol where network traffic is sent according to a certain priority will actually improve throughput for all nodes in the network. The proposed protocol will ideally also maintain its increased performance even when all nodes on the network are not operating under the same protocol. 




\section{Analysis}
\label{section:analysis}

A basic simulation was used to analyse and compare the results from the standard fair WiFi protocol versus the previously mentioned biased protocols. The protocols were tested with a network consisting of **** end nodes with the nodes sending data following the distribution of data according to *Citation needed* %\cite{}
The standard WiFi protocol is used as the basis of comparison that the other protocols are measured against as a protocol that does not doesn't at least match the throughput of WiFi's current protocol dos not meet the requirements of improving the throughput the network. In the simulation, it is assumed that all end nodes on the network are following the same protocol, everynode behaves in the same manner as other nodes.
